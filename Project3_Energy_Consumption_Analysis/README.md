## üìù Problem Statement  
This project was designed to analyze **renewable and non-renewable energy consumption patterns** across different regions, countries, and income levels.  

The main objectives were to:  
- Monitor **monthly usage trends** segmented by region, country, and energy source.  
- Analyze **impact of income levels** on energy usage and cost savings.  
- Provide decision-makers with **insights into sustainable energy adoption** and opportunities for cost optimization.  
- Develop a **cloud-integrated pipeline** from raw dataset to interactive dashboard for scalable analytics.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Followed  

- **Step 1:** Created an **Amazon S3 bucket** and uploaded the raw dataset.  
- **Step 2:** Configured an **IAM Role** with proper trust policy for secure Snowflake integration.  
- **Step 3:** Established **S3 ‚Üí Snowflake integration** using external stage object.  
- **Step 4:** Loaded the dataset into **Snowflake (SQL Worksheet)** for further processing.  
- **Step 5:** Performed **data analysis & transformations** in Snowflake:  
  - Increased **monthly usage** depending on income level:  
    - +10% for Low income  
    - +20% for Middle income  
    - +30% for High income  
  - Adjusted **cost savings** inversely:  
    - -10% for Low income  
    - -20% for Middle income  
    - -30% for High income  
- **Step 6:** Connected Snowflake with **Tableau Desktop**
- **Step 7:** Designed dashboards including the following visuals :  
  - **Monthly Usage (KWH) by Country** ‚Äì Compares electricity consumption levels across different countries to identify high and low usage patterns.  
  - **Cost Saving (USD) by Country** ‚Äì Displays cost savings achieved per country, highlighting differences in energy efficiency.  
  - **Monthly Usage (KWH) by Region** ‚Äì Aggregates and compares energy consumption across global regions.  
  - **Monthly Usage (KWH) by Energy Source** ‚Äì Shows consumption distribution across renewable energy sources such as Biomass, Hydro, Solar, Wind, and Geothermal.  
  - **Cost Saving (USD) by Region** ‚Äì Highlights regional variations in monetary savings due to energy consumption efficiency.  
  - **Cost Savings (USD) by Energy Source** ‚Äì Demonstrates how different renewable sources contribute to overall cost savings, emphasizing economic impact.  

- **Step 8:** Published dashboards to **Tableau Cloud** for wider accessibility.

# üîé Insights  

From the dashboard, the following key insights were observed:  

‚ö° **Usage Trends**  
- High-income groups show **greater energy consumption growth**, but **lower relative cost savings** due to adjusted scaling.  
- Low-income regions adopt renewables at a **slower pace**, highlighting policy intervention needs.  

üåç **Regional Observations**  
- Certain countries exhibit **sharp renewable adoption trends**, while others remain reliant on non-renewables.  
- Regions with higher GDP generally have a **diverse energy mix** compared to single-source dependency in developing countries.  

üí∞ **Cost Savings Patterns**  
- Savings decline as income levels rise, despite higher overall consumption ‚Üí signals potential inefficiency in energy subsidy allocation.  

üìà **Sustainability Opportunities**  
- Countries with high renewable adoption align with **global sustainability goals**, while lagging regions indicate **growth potential** for clean energy investments.
